# 🚀 Minishell - 1337 School Project

## 🔹 Introduction
Minishell is a simplified Unix shell that mimics the behavior of Bash. It implements core functionalities such as command execution, pipelines, redirections, and environment variable handling. This project leverages system programming techniques and key system calls like `execve()`, `fork()`, `pipe()`, `dup2()`, and `readline()`, `etc...`.

## 🏗️ Key Components

### 🔸 Lexer (Tokenizer)
Breaks user input into meaningful tokens.

Identifies commands, arguments, operators (`()`, `||`, `&&`, `|`, `>`, `<`, `>>`, `<<`), and environment variables (`$HOME`).

**Example:**    
ls | wc -l || cat file.txt && echo "Hello world!"

**This is tokenized into:**            
[ls] [|] [wc -l] [||] [cat file.txt] [&&] [echo "Hello world!"]

**AST Tree Representation**        

For the command:                 
[ls] [|] [wc -l] [||] [cat file.txt] [&&] [echo "Hello world!"]

                    &&
                 /      \
               ||       echo "Hello world!"
             /    \
           |     cat file.txt
        ls   wc -l

## ⚡ Operators & Features

### 🔹 Redirections

- **`<`** - Redirect input:  
  Example: `cat < file.txt`
  
- **`>`** - Redirect output:  
  Example: `ls > output.txt`
  
- **`>>`** - Append output:  
  Example: `ls >> output.txt`
  
- **`<<`** - Here document:  
  Example: `cat << EOF`

### 🔹 Pipes
- **`|`** - Connects the output of one command to the input of another:  
  Example: `ls | grep minishell`

### 🔹 Logical Operators

- **`&&`** - Execute next command if the previous succeeds:  
  Example: `ls && echo "Success"`
  
- **`||`** - Execute next command if the previous fails:  
  Example: `ls || echo "Failed"`

### 🔹 Wildcards

- **`*`** - Matches any number of characters:  
  Example: `ls *.txt`

### 🔹 Environment Variables

- **`$`** - Expands environment variables:  
  Example: `echo $HOME`
  
- **`$?`** - Expands to the last command’s exit status:  
  Example: `echo $?`
  
- **`$USER`** - Expands to the current user:  
  Example: `echo $USER`
---
## 📌 Built-in Commands

- `cd` - Change directory
- `echo` - Print messages
- `export` - Set environment variables
- `unset` - Remove environment variables
- `env` - Print environment variables
- `exit` - Terminate the shell
---
## 📌 Signal Handling
Manages signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C), `SIGQUIT` (Ctrl+D), and `SIGTSTP` (Ctrl+Z).

Uses system calls: `signal()`, `sigaction()`, `kill()`

## 🎯 Reflection
The Minishell project was a fascinating journey into the heart of shell programming. It offered me a hands-on experience with process creation, command parsing, and system calls that are fundamental to building a shell. 🖥️ The challenges of implementing pipes, redirections, and error handling pushed me to think critically about how to manage resources and memory efficiently. 💡
I worked on this project as part of a group of two students, which provided valuable experience in collaborative problem-solving and team communication. By diving deep into system-level programming, I’ve gained invaluable insights into how shells operate under the hood. I’m eager to apply this knowledge to more advanced projects. This experience has fueled my growth as a developer, and I’m excited to continue exploring new topics and pushing my limits. 🚀
